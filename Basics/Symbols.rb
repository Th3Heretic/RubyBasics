# A Symbol is a lightweight, immutable identifier often used for names or labels. Symbols are more
# memory-efficient than strings because they are immutable and reusable across the program.

# They typically appear like this:
:name         # Symbol
:age          # Symbol

# Symbols are commonly used as keys in hashes (more on hashes in the Hashes.rb file).
# A symbol is always preceded by a colon (:), and unlike strings, symbols canâ€™t be modified.
