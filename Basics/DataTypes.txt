<h1>Data Types</h1>

<h2>Ruby supports various data types such as:</h2>

	•	Strings: "hello"
	        A String is a sequence of characters. In Ruby, strings can be written using single quotes ' or
	        double quotes ". Double quotes allow string interpolation and special characters like \n (newline).
	•	Numbers: 42, 3.14
	        age = 30   Integer
	        price = 19.99  Float
	            Ruby automatically distinguishes between Integer and Float based on the presence of a
	            decimal point. Arithmetic operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*),
	            and division (/) work with both.
	•	Booleans: true, false
	•	Arrays: ["apple", "banana", "pear"]
	•	Hashes (Dictionaries): {"name" => "Jack", "age" => 25}
